# Project Overview

This is a Kubernetes controller that automatically updates Cloudflare DNS records based on node IPs. Here are the key components:

- [main.go](mdc:main.go) - The main controller logic and reconciliation loop
- [go.mod](mdc:go.mod) - Project dependencies and module definition
- [Dockerfile](mdc:Dockerfile) - Container image build instructions
- [deploy/deployment.yaml](mdc:deploy/deployment.yaml) - Kubernetes deployment manifests

The controller watches Ingress resources and updates Cloudflare DNS records to point to the node's public IP where the ingress backend service's first pod is running.
